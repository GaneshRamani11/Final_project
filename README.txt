About the Assignment : (My learnings)

I have used Three JS and the three JS build in my assignment Construction .

I have Built a cube With 3D dimensions . Please move the mouse cursor to see the 3D cube .
I have also built a cone, Cylinder , Sphere in 3D.


I have tried to construct a Basic 3D tree which can be rendered using the modules of three JS.
The tree uses a Cone and Cylinder to render a Basic Model of a tree using primitive Geometry.

I have used Orbit controls which is embedded in the Build of Three JS to move the object around with the mouse to see the different perspective camera angles for my rendering .

I have Also constructed a Web page which can render objets like 
Cone
Cube 
Cylinder
Sphere 

With user input iterations to render a model n different times and have placed it at positions of XYZ + 100 from the initial position. I have used orbit controls to track the mouse movements.

I have rendered all the Images in the Website on a Canvas element.

REFERENCES :


I have used various web resources:


Three Js Beginner tutorials to construct a Cube on Youtube.

I have used the Official Three JS module from the Three JS website to download the Build and orbit control Files.

I have visited three JS website to find out about the materials and different types of Geometry's available to construct the Website.

I have Used CSS tricks.com to style my Web Page.
